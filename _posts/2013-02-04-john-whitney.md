title: John Whitney
---

I had not heard of John Whitney until a couple of years ago when I was looking around the net for some insiprational old school animations. I didnt think anyone would have been creating these in the 1960's so was shocked when I came along this. Its very abstract but I find ideas poping into my head when I watch it. Its appearently created using a self-constucted analogue computer which makes use of an WWII anti-aircraft gun site. Enjoy!
