title: "Android Security: Beware of the default IV!"
---

A quick one today. 

A couple of people I have spoken to recently have been unaware of the need to ensure a random IV is being used when performing AES encryption on Android.

_What is an IV?_

> In cryptography, an initialization vector (IV) or starting variable (SV)[1] is a fixed-size input to a cryptographic primitive that is typically required to be random or pseudorandom. Randomization is crucial for encryption schemes to achieve semantic security, a property whereby repeated usage of the scheme under the same key does not allow an attacker to infer relationships between segments of the encrypted message. For block ciphers, the use of an IV is described by the modes of operation. _[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initialization_vector)_

The unawareness seems to fall into two camps:

1. I didn't know I needed to use an IV
2. I am using the IV that is generated by the Cipher

## I didn't know I needed to use an IV

[Yup!](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/35210/encrypting-using-aes-256-do-i-need-iv/35216#35216)

## I am using the IV that is generated by the Cipher

[Uh oh!](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31036780/android-cryptography-api-not-generating-safe-iv-for-aes)

## Enforcing a random IV

It's worth explicitly declaring an IV to avoid the vulns introduced with either of the above two approaches. This can be as simple as:

<div data-gist-id="2ce511580419cdcec7ec2ef886e91e4f">1</div>

[Some](https://developer.android.com/reference/javax/crypto/Cipher.html) of the Android examples do now suggest this, but I find it can be easy to forget when looking at [other](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/security/keystore/KeyGenParameterSpec.html) example code.
